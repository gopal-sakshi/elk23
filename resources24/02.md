two main ways to search in Elasticsearch:
- queries
- aggregations


`queries`
- retrieve documents that match the criteria.


curl -XGET "http://es01:9200/news_index24/_search"
- displays number of hits, sample of 10 search results
- by default, only 10k docs are searched


`aggregations`
- summarizes your data as metrics, statistics, other analytics.
- 

combination of query and aggregation request
- search for the most significant term in a category
