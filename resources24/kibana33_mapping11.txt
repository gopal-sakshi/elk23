==================================================================================

By default, every string gets mapped twice
- as a text field and 
- as a keyword multi-field


Text field type 
- designed for full-text searches. 
- search for individual terms in a non-case sensitive manner.

Keyword field type
- designed for exact searches, aggregations, sorting. 
- searching for original strings.

we can assign the field type as either
- text      or
- keyword   or
- both

say a request comes ---> full-text-search ---> "new zealand"
asking to fetch all documents containing the terms "new" or "zealand"
ES doesn't read through every document for the search terms (new, zealand). 
It goes straight to the inverted index to look up the search terms, 
finds the matching document ids (1,3) and sends the ids back to the user.
The inverted index is the reason Elasticsearch is able to search with speed.

keyword field type
- used for aggregations, sorting, exact search
- lookup the documentID - to find values it has in its fields
- "doc values" data structure
- this data structure(doc values) is designed 
- for actions that require looking up the document ID to find the values it has in its fields



========================================================================

In cases where you do not need both field types, the default setting is wasteful. 
Since both field types require creating 
    either an inverted index (text field type) 
    or doc values (keyword field type) 
- creating both field types for unnecessary fields will 
    slow down indexing & 
    take up more disk space.


===========================================================================

client requirements
- search for produce name, country of origin, description
    full text search
    bcoz -- no aggregation, exact search needed
- identify top countries of origin with the most frequent purchase history
    
- sort produce by produce type(fruit or vegetable)
- get the summary of monthly expense
